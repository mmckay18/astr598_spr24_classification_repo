# Classifying time series

- develop 3 approaches for classifying time series
- the initial approach should extract features from a time series (e.g. using cesium-ml) and apply a GMM classifier (you will need to define how you will classify a continuous function such as period). The classifier should be robust to changes in the phase of the time series
- one of the approaches should use a neural network approach
- compare the performance for each of the data sets
